## Origins

> The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu by the Chinese Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi, who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).— [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#Origins)
> In the book, the game was called shoushiling. Li Rihua's book Note of Liuyanzhai also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (t. 手勢令; s. 手势令), huozhitou (t. 豁指頭; s. 豁指头), or huaquan (划拳).

## Spread beyond East Asia

> By the early 20th century, rock paper scissors had spread beyond East Asia, especially through increased Japanese contact with the west.[15] Its English-language name is therefore taken from a translation of the names of the three Japanese hand-gestures for rock, paper and scissors:[16] elsewhere in East Asia the open-palm gesture represents "cloth" rather than "paper".[17] The shape of the scissors is also adopted from the Japanese style.[16] — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#Spread_beyond_East_Asia)
